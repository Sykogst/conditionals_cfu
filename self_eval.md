# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - It is useful when we the program to execute different things depending on varying conditions/scenarios.
2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - I need to be more brave with the recording the video section, it definitely took me the longest compared to everything else - to prepare the energy to do it in the first place.
3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - I enjoyed that I figured out how to write a single conditional in one line, as well as an if/else statement in one line (ternary statement).
